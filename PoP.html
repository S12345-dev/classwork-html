        <h2>What is a hyper car</h2>
        <h2>Why they are so coooool</h2>
        <p>Early on in hypercar history, it was
             rumored that hypercars got their name 
            because the hyper prefix was a shortened 
            version of “high performance,” which is obviously
             a nod to a hypercar's incredible capabilities.</p>
